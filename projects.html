                    <h3>Rapid Resume</h3>
                    <p>Rapid Resume is an app concept developed by Team GADS during the hackathon conducted by NTU. The app aims to streamline the job application process by providing a comprehensive platform for users to manage their job search activities. It includes features such as creating and storing resumes, managing certificates, and facilitating networking similar to LinkedIn.</p>
                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The objective of Rapid Resume is to simplify and enhance the job application experience by offering a centralized platform for users to manage their professional profiles, documents, and networking activities.</p>
                    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Flutter, Dart</p>
                    <p><strong>Key Features:</strong> Resume creation and storage, certificate management, networking functionalities</p>

                    <h3>Virtual Self Driving Car</h3>
                    <p>The Virtual Self Driving Car project is a Python application built using the Kivy framework. It simulates a self-driving car navigating through different levels to reach its destination. The AI driving the car learns from its experiences to improve its performance over time.</p>
                    <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> The project was motivated by the challenge of creating a virtual environment to test and develop AI algorithms for autonomous vehicles.</p>
                    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, Kivy framework</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenges and Solutions:</strong> One of the main challenges faced during development was designing realistic driving scenarios and implementing an AI algorithm capable of learning from its experiences. This was overcome by experimenting with different approaches and fine-tuning the AI model to improve its performance.</p>

                    <h3>VizDoom</h3>
                    <p>VizDoom is a Python project developed using the Gym framework. It is based on the classic first-person shooter game Doom, where players navigate through levels, shoot enemies, and reach the treasure. In this project, an AI agent is trained to play the game autonomously.</p>
                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The main goal of the VizDoom project is to develop an AI agent capable of navigating the game environment, avoiding obstacles, defeating enemies, and ultimately reaching the treasure.</p>
                    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, Gym framework</p>
                    <p><strong>Insights:</strong> Working on the VizDoom project provided valuable insights into reinforcement learning techniques and their application in complex gaming environments. It also demonstrated the potential of AI agents to learn and adapt to dynamic game scenarios.</p>

                    <h3>Breakout</h3>
                    <p>Breakout is a game developed using Python, featuring artificial intelligence to destroy blocks at the top of the screen. The player controls a moving board at the bottom of the screen to prevent the ball from falling down. The goal is to clear all the blocks by bouncing the ball off the board and hitting them.</p>
                    <p><strong>Inspiration:</strong> The project was inspired by classic arcade games like Breakout and Arkanoid, which involve bouncing a ball to destroy blocks.</p>
                    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, Pygame</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenges and Insights:</strong> Developing Breakout likely involved challenges such as designing the game mechanics, implementing collision detection, and training the AI agent to play the game effectively. Insights gained from this project may include understanding game development principles, reinforcement learning algorithms, and problem-solving skills.</p>
